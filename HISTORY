13MAY2007

Got rid of XML as data storage (still exported for Web usage
at the moment) updated all tests; basically should be close
to working, with a multi-round tournament file. Added .TOU
writing. Imported into svn's trunk.

Added XML throughout, most tests converted (until
I realised XML is not the way to go).
