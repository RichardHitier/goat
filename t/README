Files are named along the following rules:

- Scenario number as extension
- "_in" for input file, "_out" for output file
 (Typically, "pairs_in" and "pairs_out")
- out.x for expected stdout

Check 'run' to see what files correspond to what scenario

The general philosophy is to check the output of commands
rather than the contents of the files: the files represent
internal states, and testing against the specification
should be enough. That way it's easy to change file format,
too.

To run all the tests:
t/run
from the top directory.
